# YourSweeper

### What is YourSweeper? It sounds like a word play on Minesweeper...
Exactly! This is a Python recreation of Minesweeper, using Unicode graphics and running in the IDE. No external APIs are used except for one instance of Random.

### How does it work?
The program works exactly like Minesweeper, except its controls are input-based. For example, instead of clicking on the square, you need to input the row and column of the square to dig for a mine.

### There are random unrecognizable symbols in the python code! What are those?
It seems like Github is unable to recognize some of the unicode characters used in the game. It should be fine once you download/copy the code and run it in your IDE. That being said, it is not yet tested on all systems (I use Windows 10 currently). Please contact me if any issues come up.

### I don't like those unicode characters. May I use my own?
For sure! There are documentations telling you what each symbol represent, so you can just copy-paste your new symbol in the corresponding sections. You can also customize the dialogue/sentences in the game, as well as the technical configurations.

### Minesweeper is hard. I have no idea how to complete a full game.
That's why the game comes with Cheat Mode! Set it to True and reveal the mines at the beginning of the game!
